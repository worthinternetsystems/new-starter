        We'll be getting you into a project as quickly as possible. We operate a
        lot as a mob (you'll understand more about what that means as you go
        along). It's essentially a team, but you'll work on the same thing
        together. This is quicker than working as individuals, because you can
        make decisions much quicker. More important at the moment, though, is
        that it's a great place to learn. It'll put you in driving seat quickly
        and you'll have the support so you won't feel alone and you won't fear
        mistakes. You'll being code in the open and learning rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        To work in the mob you're going to have to get connected to the source
        code (github, bitbucket, Azure Devops etc) - i.e. the products we build
        - get connected to the project mission / goals - i.e. what we're
        building and why. Our teams are often a hybrid of WORTH employees,
        contractors and clients - we're all aligned on the common goal so we're
        all equal, open and mostly friendly. You'll get invites to common
        ceremonies such as stand ups, show and tells.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll also need to log your time (Harvest). Once we're out of lock down
        you may need to claim expenses (Expensify). You'll probably want to book
        holidays (timestastic).

        And finally we meet up several times a week for some group activities.
        We do prefer to meet up in person, but we're in interesting times at the
        moment so get used to lots of zoom, google meetings and slack calls. We
        have a social once a week currently called Thirsty Thursday, or
        DigiDrinks if we have it on Friday. We also have guild meetings, company
        updates every other week. NL run Guilds as well, which are great to get
        in to.
