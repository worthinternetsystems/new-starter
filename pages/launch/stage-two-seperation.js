          By now you should be delivering bits of value every day to the
          product(s) youâ€™re connected to. You should also have a go at updating
          the onboarding process for the next person. Your trials and
          tribulations of onboarding are still fresh in your mind, so if you can
          improve the process for the next starter, that'd be awesome. You
          should recognise the names of everyone in the #worth-reading channel.
          We're a small team, so do make sure you've had a chance to say hello
          to everyone.
